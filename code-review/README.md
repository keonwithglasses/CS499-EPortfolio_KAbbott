# Code Review – Keon Abbott

Welcome to the Code Review section of my ePortfolio. I'm Keon Abbott, and this review is part of my final project for CS 499. I presented my code review using American Sign Language (ASL), highlighting three major projects—each aligned with a core area of computer science.

## What You'll Find Here

This folder contains my code review transcript and a video link (if hosted externally due to file size limits). The video is a walkthrough of the following projects:

1. **Software Design & Engineering**  
   - *Artifact*: `ExceptionsActivity_KAbbott.cpp`  
   - Focused on custom exception handling, logging, and planned refactoring for modularity and reliability.

2. **Algorithms & Data Structures**  
   - *Artifact*: `TreasureHuntGame_KAbbott_Project2Milestone.ipynb`  
   - A Q-learning agent trained to find treasure in a maze using reinforcement learning. I enhanced it with epsilon decay and plan to visualize training progress with matplotlib.

3. **Databases**  
   - *Artifact*: `Travlr Getaways Full Stack App`  
   - Backend app built with Node.js and MongoDB. I plan to add input sanitization, case-insensitive search using RegEx, and database indexing for speed and security.

## Why ASL?

As a Deaf developer, I presented this review in ASL to reflect my communication style and bring accessibility to technical presentations. The transcript (`CS 499_Transcript_KAbbott.docx`) is included for anyone who prefers or needs a written version.

This README helps reviewers understand my coding approach, improvements made, and how these projects align with course outcomes in software engineering, algorithms, and database design.
