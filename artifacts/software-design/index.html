        <h2>Exception Handling with Error Logging</h2>
        <p>
            This project comes from my Secure Coding course, where I worked on building better error handling using C++ exception management. The enhanced version includes a custom exception class, an isolated error logger, and clear separation of logic to make debugging and maintenance easier.

        <p>
            My original file was a basic demonstration, but I restructured it to better reflect real-world software practices. I added a test function, cleaner comments, and improved readability throughout. The idea wasn’t just to fix what was there—it was to level it up into something that could live in a real application with better logging and fault isolation.

            This artifact highlights my ability to write clean, modular code with maintainability in mind—something I’ve grown to value more deeply the closer I get to working in the field. This kind of thinking helps when working on embedded systems or designing secure, reliable tools—especially in mission-driven industries like aerospace.

            Comments labeled with (KA) in the code reflect my thought process and enhancements throughout.
