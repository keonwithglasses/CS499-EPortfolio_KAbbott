# Welcome to My CS 499 Capstone Portfolio

Hi, I am Keon Abbott, and this is my professional ePortfolio for the CS 499 Capstone course at SNHU.

This site showcases enhancements to three key projects I have worked on during my time in the Computer Science program:
- **Software Design & Engineering**: Secure Coding (CS 405)
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Q-Learning Treasure Hunt (CS 370)
- **Databases**: Travlr Getaways Full Stack App (CS 465)

These projects reflect my growth in full-stack development, secure system design, and algorithmic thinking. I am especially focused on building accessible, scalable, and real-world solutions as I pursue a future in aerospace engineering and beyond.

Stay tuned for more sections and updates coming soon!
