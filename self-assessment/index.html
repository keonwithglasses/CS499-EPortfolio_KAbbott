                The journey to completing this ePortfolio has been more than just checking boxes for graduation. It’s a reflection of the work I’ve put in over the years, the skills I’ve grown, and the vision I have for the future. As someone who is Deaf, I’ve had to think about access and inclusion in ways many don’t—and that awareness is a big part of who I am as a developer. I’m not just here to build software that works. I’m here to build software that <strong>works for everyone</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This ePortfolio brings together the best examples of my growth across software design, algorithms, and databases—but it also shows how I think. How I problem-solve. How I make technical decisions with purpose. Every enhancement I made, every design decision, was an opportunity to push further—not just to meet requirements, but to raise the bar for myself.
            </p>

            <p>
                I didn’t start this program with all the answers. In fact, there were moments I felt stuck—struggling with tools, debugging late into the night, or just trying to find that one bug holding everything up. But I always found a way forward. Whether it was breaking the problem down visually, stepping away to clear my head with a LEGO build, or relying on the clarity that comes from clean, structured code—I kept going. And now I can see how far that consistency has taken me.
            </p>

            <p>
                Accessibility, security, and clean design are the pillars of my development mindset. I make sure my code is readable, well-commented, and respectful of different user experiences. If someone’s using assistive tech, I want them to feel considered. If a project is touched by someone else later on, I want them to understand it quickly. If data is involved, I want it protected. Those aren’t just professional values—they’re personal to me.
            </p>

            <p>
                I came into this program with real goals: to become a software engineer, to explore embedded systems, and one day apply what I know to something bigger—maybe even in aerospace or meteorology. This portfolio is my proof of progress. It captures not just the work I’ve done, but the kind of developer I’ve become.
            </p>

            <p>
                And I’m just getting started.
